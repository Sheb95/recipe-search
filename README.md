>#Recipe Generator

>##Introduction

>This started of as a weekly hackerthon challenge for my bootcamp (The School Of Code). For this task,  this website needed to fetch and display API data from a online RESTAPI at the user's request. For instance, if the user types in "tofu" into the search bar and presses the search button, data from the recipe API about "tofu" should be acquired then displayed on the webpage the user sees. However, by the end of the challenge, I only able to get data for one recipe in the browser console and did not manage to display it on the webpage. 

>Thus, I decided to use this as a foundation to build my own personal project. The aims of this project are: 
>>1. To use arrary methods (such as for-each) to obtain API data
>>2. To display API data on the Document Object Model (DOM) of the webpage
>>3. To understand how asynchronous functions work
>>4. To improve CSS skills

>This project will not be pretty. However, I hope that the more I learn during my time at the bootcamp, I am able to expand upon this website using what I have learned in class as well as my own research.
